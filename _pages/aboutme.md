I am Han Zhou at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Despite my major in German Languages and Literatures, I have developed strong theoretical and experimental skills in linguistics, especially in psycholinguistics. Out of strong interest and curiosity in linguistics, I plan to pursue the postgraduate study and work as a researcher/linguist in the future.

During my undergraduate study, I have conducted two research projects in psycholinguistics. The first investigates the processing of subject-verb agreement among Chinese-English L2 speakers with evidence from P600, which was nominated as a national-level Undergraduate Innovation Program. I came up with my sencond research idea regarding real-time discourse processing and inference through questioning the journals of Hoek (2020 & 2021), and designed further eye-tracking experiments in Chinese, hoping to investigate the regulation of relative clauses on causality expectation. 

Through attending group meetings on neurolinguistics for a select few graduate students, I am familiar with using ERP studies and brain stimulations to investigate preditive mechanisms in language processing, such as the function of P3a and P3b. I am also interested in oddball effects.

I plan to further explore the relationship between language, the brain and language processing mechanisms by combining behavioural experiments with eye-tracking or ERP experiments. I would also take advantage of my knowledge of German and Chinese to investigate second/third language acquisition and explore which aspects of syntax are universal and which areas show cross-linguistic variation.
