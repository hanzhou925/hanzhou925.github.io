I am Han Zhou at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Despite my major in German Languages and Literatures, I have developed strong theoretical and experimental skills in linguistics, especially in psycholinguistics. Out of strong interest and curiosity in linguistics, I plan to pursue the postgraduate study and work as a researcher/linguist in the future.

My interest in linguistics derived from my fascination for foreign languages. At an early age, I had a determination to further pursue linguistics after learning about the historical development of languages through a course on world languages. This sparked my curiosity for cross-linguistic similarities and differences and the processes involved in human language acquisition. 
During my undergraduate study, I have conducted two research projects in psycholinguistics and attended group meetings on neurolinguistics designed for a select few graduate students, which profoundly enhanced my insights and knowledge in these areas. I plan to further explore the relationship between language, the brain and language processing mechanisms by combining behavioural experiments with eye-tracking or ERP experiments. I would also take advantage of my knowledge of German and Chinese to investigate second/third language acquisition and explore which aspects of syntax are universal and which areas show cross-linguistic variation.
